                pip install django_select2
        
        2. Add `django_select2` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your project settings.
        
        3. Add `django_select` to your urlconf if you use any 'Auto' fields.
        
                url(r'^select2/', include('django_select2.urls')),
        
        
        ### Upgrade from Version 4
        
        Version 5 is a complete rewrite of the package to drastically reduce
        the code base and to ensure a future maintainability.
        
        While we feature set remained unchanged, the API changed completely.
        Major changes:
        - Fields have been removed in favor of widgets.
        - All version 4 settings have been removed.
        - Template tags have been removed.
        - 3rd party javascript is served by a CDN.
        - No more inline javascript code.
        
        #### Upgrade can be done in 5 simple steps:
        
        1. Remove all existing and to setup the new cache backend.
        2. Remove the old template tags from your templates:
         1. `import_django_select2_js`
         2. `import_django_select2_css`
         3. `import_django_select2_js_css`
        3. Add `form.media.css` to the top and `form.media.js`
         to the bottom of your base template.
        4. Upgrade to jQuery version 2, if you are still running version 1.
        5. Replace old fields with new widgets.
        
        
        ## Documentation
        
        
        Documentation available at http://django-select2.readthedocs.io/.
        
        ## External Dependencies
        
        
        * jQuery version 2
            This is not included in the package since it is expected
            that in most scenarios this would already be available.
        
        
        ## Example Application
        
        Please see `tests/testapp` application.
        This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package.
        This also serves as a good example.
        
        ## Special Thanks
        
        
        * Samuel Goldszmidt (@ouhouhsami) for reporting many fundamental issues with the code, because of which versions 2.0 and 2.0.1 were released.
